ICON FILE REQUIRED
==================

This application requires an icon file named "icon.ico" in the project root directory.

You can create one using:
1. An online ICO converter (convert PNG/JPG to ICO)
2. Visual Studio's built-in icon editor
3. Tools like GIMP or IcoFX

The icon should be at least 32x32 pixels, but 256x256 is recommended for better quality at different sizes.

Place the icon.ico file in the root of the project directory (same folder as EliteSwitch.csproj).

For a gaming application like Elite Switch, consider using:
- A spaceship icon
- A VR headset icon
- A toggle/switch icon
- The Elite Dangerous logo (if permitted)
